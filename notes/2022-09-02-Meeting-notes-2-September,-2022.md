Above are our five subsystems. The simulator can be thought of as a sixth subsystem.

### Tasks

We have the next two weeks to:

- Clean up Navigator and release v1.2
- Write documentation to cover the basics
- Conduct our literature review

In just over two weeks, we will go over all our options for new algorithms, and we'll have new members to train and help us out.

# Roll With Us
We're Nova, UT Dallas's applied autonomous driving project. We aim to create the first open-source autonomous driving platform in Texas-- period. We've already come a long way, but we need your help to go further than ever.

Our open-source software, "Navigator," is under active development, with over 500 commits across our branches. However, there's plenty of work ahead with our perception software, planning algorithms, and more. If you're a believer in autonomous-driving, we need your help!

## Open positions
Openings for the 2022-2023 academic year will be announced by Monday, August 29th.

## Application process
Full details for 2022-2023 will be posted on Monday, August 29th. Our application consists of a simple form and a sample submission (a programming challenge for developers, for example). A selection of applicants will be asked to meet for an interview.

## Recruitment timeline
Applications open on Monday, **August 29**.

Applications close on Friday, **September 9**.

Interviews will take place from **September 12-15**.

Offers will be sent by **September 19** at latest.

## Requirements for all positions
- **Good teamwork**: Nova is a group of friendly, supportive people, and we want you to be a part.
- **Pride in our mission**: If you think self-driving cars are awesome, then we're looking for you!
- Most importantly, **dedication**. Our goals are tough-- way harder than most people realize. Our work is often frustrating and slow. We're looking for people who can **stick with it**, who know that all the frustration is worth it. Here's a quote from [an article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-17/waymo-s-self-driving-cars-are-99-of-the-way-there-the-last-1-is-the-hardest) about Waymo, a self-driving car company with a bit more resources than us:


> At first, it appeared that Waymo would produce cars at a supercharged pace. In 2018, Waymo signed up to turn as many as 20,000 Jaguar SUVs into Waymo autonomous vehicles. Months later, it said it would expand its fleet of Chrysler Pacifica minivans to more than 60,000. Waymo planned to buy the cars and install what it called its “Driver”—a suite of cameras, sensors, and proprietary computer gear. <br/><br/> “There’s not a lot in assembly,” then-CEO John Krafcik, a former auto executive, declared at an event that year.
In reality, skilled disassembly is required. Engineers must take apart the cars and put them back together by hand. One misplaced wire can leave engineers puzzling for days over where the problem is...

- More specifically, you should be able to dedicate at least <u><b>5 hours per week</b></u> while classes are in session.
- If you're worried that you don't have enough experience, but you're still really interested, **apply anyway**. Dedication is more valuable than experience. Try your best with the sample submission, and we'd still like to interview you afterwards.

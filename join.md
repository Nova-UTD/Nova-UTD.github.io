# Roll With Us
We're Voltron, UT Dallas's applied autonomous driving project. We've already come a long way, but we need your help as we go further than ever.

In our first major milestone, Demo 1, Voltron steering itself through the world. We're now working to write a new behavior planner, a steering controller, an ML-based obstacle detector, and more.

## Open positions

### Software/Algorithm Developer (C++)
Do algorithms like Normal Distribution Transform and Extended Kalman Filters excite you? Are you able to learn on your own, dive into source code, and write clean applications?

Software developers on our team do more than write code. You should have strong math and communication skills, be comfortable learning new skills on your own, and enjoy working with like-minded developers on a team.

### Web Developer
Our robot reads lots of sensor data and makes lots of calculations. All this data forms a thick web that's often confusing to understand. We'd like to **write a web interface** that can parse data from our stack and visualize it all through a web app.

You should have experience in front-end development (React, Angular, or similar) and backend development (Flask, Node, or similar).

### 3D Artist
Before we test our code on our real car, we first run everything in [a simulator](https://www.svlsimulator.com/). We'd love to have a custom model for [our car](https://gem.polaris.com/en-us/e6/build-color/?selectedmodel=passengerlsv&colorid=617275), as well as a 3D environment to represent areas of UT Dallas's campus. 

There are lots of other areas of our project that would keep a 3D artist busy: visualizations, GUI animations, an interactive assistant, and so on.

### Public Relations Director
This person would serve as our liason to our campus community and the outside world. They would write updates and post them on our website, take pictures and videos of our work, and possibly manage our social media presence.

How many PR specialists represent a self-driving car program? Exactly.

## Requirements for all positions
- **Good teamwork**: Voltron is a group of friendly, supportive people, and we want you to be a part.
- **Pride in our mission**: If you think self-driving cars are awesome, then we're looking for you!
- Most importantly, **dedication**. Our goals are tough-- way harder than people realize. Our work is often frustrating and slow. We're looking for people who can stick with it, who know that all the frustration is worth it. Here's a quote from [an article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-17/waymo-s-self-driving-cars-are-99-of-the-way-there-the-last-1-is-the-hardest) about Waymo, widely considered the best self-driving car company in the world:


> At first, it appeared that Waymo would produce cars at a supercharged pace. In 2018, Waymo signed up to turn as many as 20,000 Jaguar SUVs into Waymo autonomous vehicles. Months later, it said it would expand its fleet of Chrysler Pacifica minivans to more than 60,000. Waymo planned to buy the cars and install what it called its “Driver”—a suite of cameras, sensors, and proprietary computer gear.

> “There’s not a lot in assembly,” then-CEO John Krafcik, a former auto executive, declared at an event that year.
In reality, skilled disassembly is required. Engineers must take apart the cars and put them back together by hand. One misplaced wire can leave engineers puzzling for days over where the problem is...

As one final push to get things ready for our fall semester, Voltron underwent a full wiring cleanup. Sketchy soldering jobs were replaced with weatherproof automotive connectors, confusing bunches of wiring spaghetti were replaced with tangle-free conduit, and new components like CAN bus chips were mounted firmly in place.

Of course clean wiring eliminates frustration, but it's also much safer than the messy alternative. Firm electrical connections are less prone to short circuits, unexpected cuts, and other unwanted behavior. We felt it important to address our wiring immediately in our effort to make Voltron as safe and stable as possible.

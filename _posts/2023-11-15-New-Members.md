Welcome aboard, all new NOVA members! 

This is our largest recruiting year ever; we welcomed 14 new
members to the team. 9 of which are part of the development team and 4 of which are part of the
Hardware, Firmware and Electrical (HFE) team. The positive energy and work ethic that we have seen
from this team in just this short period of time gives us high hopes for what this group of talented
individuals can accomplish in the next year. Our current team composition is as follows:

Our development team consists of returning member Stepan Antonyuk, and new members Neil
Agrawal, Ahmad Bajwa, Anjana Bharadwaj, Vindhya Kaushal, Prateek Mishra, Josh Pahman, Gueren
Sanford, Ayush Sharma, and Haneesh Tummalapalli. On our HFE team, we have returning members
Meyli Colmenero, Sasha Luich, and Jai Peris, with new members Abhinav Gummadi, Yuvraj Kashyap,
Andy Nguyen, and Akhila Varanasi. Fletcher Lauber will join our team as the new PR director where he
will manage digital media and community outreach efforts, and Kyle Zeng will be our photographer.

Daniel Vayman will be our project lead, and the one and only Justin Ruths will be our glorious
supervisor and advisor.

In true NOVA fashion, we would also like to say goodbye to last year’s members who have moved on
from the project. We appreciate all their valuable contributions to the team, and we would not have
come close to our goals without their commitment to the project.
We have a lot in store for this year, so we would like to briefly explain what we have coming up and
where you can keep up with us!

Last year culminated in [Demo 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHjxz3qC8Q8), where Hail Bopp drove us 2 miles east of
campus with no hands on the wheel! We consider it a huge success, and great proof of concept. This
year, we have BIG plans to show what Nova is truly capable of. Our software and hardware have much
to improve and expand upon, so we’ll be busy. 

<!--- For more detailed information regarding our goals,
please visit ```annual plans will be added to website soon``` for our software and vehicle annual plans respectively. --> 

Also for this year, we’ll be much, MUCH more active on social media and beyond. One event coming up
soon is the Richardson Holiday Parade. Keep an eye out Hail Bopp!

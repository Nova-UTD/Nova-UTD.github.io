# Perception

## About
Navigator is an autonomous driving system (ADS) maintained by Nova at UT Dallas. Our goals are to be:
- Open source
    - Our code is provided under the MIT license.
- Modular
    - With ROS2 as our backbone, our system can be run all at once or one piece at a time.
    - Individual algorithms, or even entire subsystems, can be modified or replaced.
- Feature-rich
    - Our provided nodes can be easily combined into a complete self-driving stack.

<h1 id="roll-with-us">Roll With Us</h1>
<p>We‚Äôre Nova, UT Dallas‚Äôs applied autonomous driving project. We aim to create the first open-source autonomous driving platform in Texas‚Äì period. We‚Äôve already come a long way, but we need your help to go further than ever.</p>

<p>Our open-source software, ‚ÄúNavigator,‚Äù is under active development, with over 500 commits across our branches. However, there‚Äôs plenty of work ahead with our perception software, planning algorithms, and more. If you‚Äôre a believer in autonomous-driving, we need your help!</p>

<h2 id="open-positions">Open positions</h2>
<h3 id="development-lead">Development lead</h3>
<p>We‚Äôre looking for someone with strong leadership abilities to manage our development team. You should have good interpersonal skills, humility, and the willingness to help your teammates succeed. You will be expected to have a familiarity with each component in our system. You will assign tasks, facilitate technical discussions, and manage our technical goals.</p>

<h4 id="you-should-be-able-to">You should be able to‚Ä¶</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Listen to your team and support them</li>
  <li>Read and understand C++ and preferably Python. You don‚Äôt need to be an expert.</li>
  <li>Understand and think through linear algebra and calculus</li>
  <li>Read and discuss research papers</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="core-developer">Core developer</h3>
<p>Core developers work on the heart of our robot. They don‚Äôt just write code, but also engineer our algorithms and create our whole system. Everything from sensor processing to behavior planning to object tracking is formed and improved by this group. If you love robotics, artificial intelligence, controls, machine vision, Nova presents a unique opportunity to combine them all to create something amazing.</p>

<h4 id="you-should-be-able-to-1">You should be able to‚Ä¶</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Work well in a team</li>
  <li>Write code in either C++ or Python</li>
  <li>Learn and apply new algorithms on the fly</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="vehicle-technician">Vehicle technician</h3>
<p>Our project already has a street-legal vehicle equipped with state-of-the-art sensors. It shoots 16 lasers at 300 RPM out of both corners. It has 3D cameras in both the front and the rear. It‚Äôs a complex beast that hasn‚Äôt been entirely tamed.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre recruiting members with expertise in either <em>firmware, mechanical,</em> or <em>electrical</em> systems. If you feel confident in more than one, apply for two or even all three. Your job is to carry our software from the simulator to the real world. In other words, vehicle technicians handle our <em>hardware interface</em>.</p>

<h3 id="firmware">Firmware</h3>
<p>Can you use an oscilloscope to find the baud rate on a CAN bus line? If not, can you figure out how? Our firmware technician will be asked to do anything from controlling our steering wheel with an Xbox controller to adding a Wifi antenna to our onboard computer.</p>

<h3 id="electrical">Electrical</h3>
<p>Our vehicle‚Äôs electrical system is mind boggling. There is both a primary and secondary power circuit, two battery banks, several I/O buses, high-voltage lines, linear actuators, electronic steering‚Ä¶ Whew! Does this scare you, excite you, or both? Our electrical technician will be responsible for diagnosing faulty batteries, locating loose wires, tackling electrical interference, and more.</p>

<h3 id="mechanical">Mechanical</h3>
<p>We‚Äôre always looking to mount new sensors, model brackets for touchscreens, find the right motors to actuate our pedals, and so on. No matter how good our code is, our vehicle is still mechanical at heart. As our mechanical technician, you will be asked to maintain and improve the mechanical systems of our vehicle.</p>

<h3 id="pr-director">PR director</h3>
<p>Our project tends to get people excited, and yet most UTD community members are unaware of our work. As PR director, you will present our work to the world through Instagram posts, videos, web articles, and however else you see fit. You will be asked to design the occasional flier with the help of our technical artist. You‚Äôll be expected to attend our outreach events, take photos of our test runs, and generally promote our mission.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/res/22-04-15_Josh_working_on_hood.jpg" alt="Josh testing our pedal actuators" /></p>

<p><small>Above: Josh testing our pedal actuators. Much of our firmware is written from scratch.</small></p>

<h2 id="requirements-for-all-positions">Requirements for all positions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>5 hours per week</strong>, including attendance during our weekly meeting (~30 minutes) and at least one collaboration session (at least 2 hours).
    <ul>
      <li>This time requirement applies for weeks when class is in session. Not finals week, not holidays.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Good teamwork</strong>: Nova is a group of friendly, supportive people, and we want you to be a part.</li>
  <li><strong>Pride in our mission</strong>: If you think self-driving cars are awesome, then we‚Äôre looking for you!</li>
  <li>Most importantly, <strong>dedication</strong>. Our goals are tough‚Äì way harder than most people realize. Our work is often frustrating and slow. We‚Äôre looking for people who can stick with it, who know that all the frustration is worth it. Here‚Äôs a quote from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-17/waymo-s-self-driving-cars-are-99-of-the-way-there-the-last-1-is-the-hardest">an article</a> about Waymo, a self-driving car company with a bit more resources than us:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>At first, it appeared that Waymo would produce cars at a supercharged pace. In 2018, Waymo signed up to turn as many as 20,000 Jaguar SUVs into Waymo autonomous vehicles. Months later, it said it would expand its fleet of Chrysler Pacifica minivans to more than 60,000. Waymo planned to buy the cars and install what it called its ‚ÄúDriver‚Äù‚Äîa suite of cameras, sensors, and proprietary computer gear.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a lot in assembly,‚Äù then-CEO John Krafcik, a former auto executive, declared at an event that year.
In reality, skilled disassembly is required. Engineers must take apart the cars and put them back together by hand. One misplaced wire can leave engineers puzzling for days over where the problem is‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>If you‚Äôre worried that you don‚Äôt have enough experience, but you‚Äôre still really interested, <strong>apply anyway</strong>. Dedication is more valuable than experience. Try your best with the sample submission, and we‚Äôd still like to interview you afterwards.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="application-instructions-and-timeline">Application instructions and timeline</h2>
<p>Our application has two parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fill out our application form (below)</li>
  <li>Submit samples for each of the positions you‚Äôd like to apply (also below)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Our application closes on Friday, Sept. 9.</strong> Please complete the above two steps by then.</p>

<p>After you complete the above steps, we may contact you to request an interview between Sept. 12-15.</p>

<p>We will send out decisions <strong>September 19</strong> at latest.</p>

<h2 id="sample-submissions">Sample submissions</h2>
<p>Samples should be submitted using the form below, with your name as the filename. If uploading more than one file, please <strong>send them as a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.zip</code> file</strong> with your name in the filename.</p>

<p>All samples will be anonymized before review.</p>

<h3 id="core-developer-and-development-lead">Core developer and development lead</h3>
<p>If applying for a developer position, please see our instructions <a href="/fall-recruiting/dev-samples">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="vehicle-technician-1">Vehicle technician</h3>
<p>Please send us examples of your previous work, such as schematics, 3D models, and/or firmware code. If your work includes additions from other people (e.g. teammates), be sure to mention this.</p>

<h3 id="pr-director-1">PR director</h3>
<p>Please do one of the following, or both:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Show us some examples of your past work. These could be blog posts, photos, illustrations, screenshots of social media posts, and so on.</li>
  <li>Suppose we‚Äôd like to invite community members to join us as spectators for a large event that we‚Äôre hosting (perhaps a livestream of a competition that we‚Äôre part of). Design some materials to promote this event. This can be as simple or as ambitious as you like, but the more creative, the better. We‚Äôd like to get a sense of your style.</li>
</ul>

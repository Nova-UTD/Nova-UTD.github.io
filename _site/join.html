<h1 id="roll-with-us">Roll With Us</h1>
<p>We‚Äôre Nova, UT Dallas‚Äôs applied autonomous driving research group. We aim to create the first open-source autonomous driving platform in Texas‚Äì period. We‚Äôve already come a long way, but we need your help to go further than ever.</p>

<p>Our open-source software, ‚ÄúNavigator,‚Äù is under active development, with over 1,000 commits across our branches. However, there‚Äôs plenty of work ahead with our perception software, planning algorithms, and more. If you‚Äôre a believer in autonomous-driving, we need your help!</p>

<h2 id="open-positions">Open positions</h2>
<p>We are currently accepting applications for a PR director and a firmware technician.</p>

<h3 id="pr-director">PR director</h3>
<p>Our project tends to get people excited, and yet most UTD community members are unaware of our work. As PR director, you will present our work to the world through Instagram posts, videos, web articles, and however else you see fit. You will be asked to design the occasional flier with the help of our technical artist. You‚Äôll be expected to attend our outreach events, take photos of our test runs, and generally promote our mission.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/res/22-04-15_Josh_working_on_hood.jpg" alt="Josh testing our pedal actuators" /></p>

<p><small>Above: Josh testing our pedal actuators. Much of our firmware is written from scratch.</small></p>

<h3 id="firmware-technician">Firmware technician</h3>
<p>Our firmware is the link between our high level algorithms (say, the route calculator) and our hardware. We write custom firmware to control our throttle pedal, turn the steering wheel, read from the battery system, and much more. You‚Äôll be expected to write and maintain all of our firmware, ensuring that every line is stable and meticulously tested. The code you write has absolute control over a real robotic car.</p>

<h2 id="requirements-for-all-positions">Requirements for all positions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>5 hours per week</strong>, including attendance during our weekly meeting (~30 minutes) and at least one collaboration session (at least 2 hours).
    <ul>
      <li>This time requirement applies for weeks when class is in session. Not finals week, not holidays.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Good teamwork</strong>: Nova is a group of friendly, supportive people, and we want you to be a part.</li>
  <li><strong>Pride in our mission</strong>: If you think self-driving cars are awesome, then we‚Äôre looking for you!</li>
  <li>Most importantly, <strong>dedication</strong>. Our goals are tough‚Äì way harder than most people realize. Our work is often frustrating and slow. We‚Äôre looking for people who can stick with it, who know that all the frustration is worth it. Here‚Äôs a quote from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-17/waymo-s-self-driving-cars-are-99-of-the-way-there-the-last-1-is-the-hardest">an article</a> about Waymo, a self-driving car company with a bit more resources than us:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>At first, it appeared that Waymo would produce cars at a supercharged pace. In 2018, Waymo signed up to turn as many as 20,000 Jaguar SUVs into Waymo autonomous vehicles. Months later, it said it would expand its fleet of Chrysler Pacifica minivans to more than 60,000. Waymo planned to buy the cars and install what it called its ‚ÄúDriver‚Äù‚Äîa suite of cameras, sensors, and proprietary computer gear.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a lot in assembly,‚Äù then-CEO John Krafcik, a former auto executive, declared at an event that year.
In reality, skilled disassembly is required. Engineers must take apart the cars and put them back together by hand. One misplaced wire can leave engineers puzzling for days over where the problem is‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>If you‚Äôre worried that you don‚Äôt have enough experience, but you‚Äôre still really interested, <strong>apply anyway</strong>. Dedication is more valuable than experience. Try your best with the sample submission, and we‚Äôd still like to interview you afterwards.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="application-instructions-and-timeline">Application instructions and timeline</h2>
<p>Please send an email to ‚Äúproject.nova@utdallas.edu‚Äù with the position you‚Äôre interested in, your resum√©, and a sample of your work. Questions can be directed to the same address.</p>

<!-- Our application has two parts:
1. Fill out our application form (below)
2. Submit samples for each of the positions you'd like to apply (also below)

**Our application closes on Friday, Sept. 9.** Please complete the above two steps by then.

After you complete the above steps, we may contact you to request an interview between Sept. 12-15.

We will send out decisions **September 19** at latest.

## Sample submissions
Samples should be submitted using the form below, with your name as the filename. If uploading more than one file, please **send them as a single `.zip` file** with your name in the filename.

All samples will be anonymized before review.

### Core developer and development lead
If applying for a developer position, please see our instructions [here](/fall-recruiting/dev-samples).

### Vehicle technician
Please send us examples of your previous work, such as schematics, 3D models, and/or firmware code. If your work includes additions from other people (e.g. teammates), be sure to mention this.

### PR director
Please submit BOTH of the following:
- Show us some examples of your past work. These could be blog posts, photos, illustrations, screenshots of social media posts, and so on.
- Suppose we'd like to invite community members to join us as spectators for a large event that we're hosting (perhaps a livestream of a competition that we're part of). Design some materials to promote this event. This can be as simple or as ambitious as you like, but the more creative, the better. We'd like to get a sense of your style.

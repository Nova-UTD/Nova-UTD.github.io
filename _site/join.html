      <h1 id="roll-with-us">Roll With Us</h1>
<p>We’re Voltron, UT Dallas’s applied autonomous driving project. We’ve already come a long way, but we need your help to go further than ever.</p>

<p>In our first major milestone, Demo 1, Voltron steered itself through the real world. We’re now working to write a new behavior planner, a steering controller, an ML-based obstacle detector, and more. To learn more about our current goals, check out the <a href="/d2-overview">Demo 2 overview</a>.</p>

<small>Our team celebrating the completion of Demo 1</small></p>
<h2 id="open-positions">Open positions</h2>

<h3 id="softwarealgorithm-developer-c">Software/Algorithm Developer (C++)</h3>
<p>Do algorithms like Normal Distribution Transform and Extended Kalman Filters excite you? Are you able to learn on your own, dive into source code, and write clean applications?</p>

<p>Software developers on our team do more than write code. You should have strong math and communication skills, be comfortable learning new skills on your own, and enjoy working with like-minded developers on a team.</p>

<h3 id="web-developer">Web Developer</h3>
<p>Our robot reads lots of sensor data and makes lots of calculations. All this data forms a thick web that’s often confusing for humans to understand. We’d like to <strong>write a web interface</strong> that can parse data from our stack and visualize it all through a web app.</p>

<p>You should have experience in front-end development (React, Angular, or similar) and backend development (Flask, Node, or similar).</p>

<h3 id="3d-artist">3D Artist</h3>
<p>Before we test our code on our real car, we first <a href="/simulation/2021/08/03/Simulated-driving.html">run everything in a simulator</a>. We’d love to have a custom model for <a href="https://gem.polaris.com/en-us/e6/build-color/?selectedmodel=passengerlsv&amp;colorid=617275">our car</a>, as well as a 3D environment to represent areas of UT Dallas’s campus.</p>

<p>There are lots of other areas of our project that would keep a 3D artist busy: visualizations, GUI animations, proofs of concept, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="public-relations-director">Public Relations Director</h3>
<p>This person would serve as our liason to our campus community and the outside world. They would write updates and post them on our website, take pictures and videos of our work, and possibly manage our social media presence.</p>

<p>How many PR specialists get to promote a self-driving car laboratory? Exactly.</p>

<h3 id="education-and-outreach-director">Education and Outreach Director</h3>
<p>Community involvement is an important part of our mission. In the past, our team has visited students at local schools, using Voltron to help teach a variety of science lessons. As our Education and Outreach Director, you’ll develop educational programming and coordinate activities with local schools so that we can continue this important mission.</p>

<p>While prior or current involvement in education (e.g. enrollment in UTeach) is encouraged, it’s not required.</p>

<h2 id="requirements-for-all-positions">Requirements for all positions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Good teamwork</strong>: Voltron is a group of friendly, supportive people, and we want you to be a part.</li>
  <li><strong>Pride in our mission</strong>: If you think self-driving cars are awesome, then we’re looking for you!</li>
  <li>Most importantly, <strong>dedication</strong>. Our goals are tough– way harder than most people realize. Our work is often frustrating and slow. We’re looking for people who can stick with it, who know that all the frustration is worth it. Here’s a quote from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-17/waymo-s-self-driving-cars-are-99-of-the-way-there-the-last-1-is-the-hardest">an article</a> about Waymo, a self-driving car company with a bit more resources than us:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>At first, it appeared that Waymo would produce cars at a supercharged pace. In 2018, Waymo signed up to turn as many as 20,000 Jaguar SUVs into Waymo autonomous vehicles. Months later, it said it would expand its fleet of Chrysler Pacifica minivans to more than 60,000. Waymo planned to buy the cars and install what it called its “Driver”—a suite of cameras, sensors, and proprietary computer gear.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There’s not a lot in assembly,” then-CEO John Krafcik, a former auto executive, declared at an event that year.
In reality, skilled disassembly is required. Engineers must take apart the cars and put them back together by hand. One misplaced wire can leave engineers puzzling for days over where the problem is…</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>More specifically, you should be able to dedicate <strong>5 hours per week</strong> through the school year– no, this doesn’t mean finals week.</li>
  <li>If you’re worried that you don’t have enough experience, but you’re still really interested, <strong>apply anyway</strong>. Dedication is more valuable than experience. Try your best with the sample submission, and we’d still like to interview you afterwards.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="application-process">Application process</h2>
<p>Our application has three parts: The form, the sample submission, and the interview. After you submit the form, we’ll email you about your sample and interveiw. In other words, the form is your first step. Applications will be reviewed on a <em>rolling basis</em>. We’re really looking forward to hearing from you! <strong>You can access the form here: <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=HR0ojU2c90uxbgMtFd6fbIFd-Rv8Ml9PhLjL-3yimtVUNkxZUzZDNjFBRTFYTkNaOFpKWkhLM0c5OS4u">Form and Sample Submissions</a></strong>.</p>

<h2 id="sample-submissions">Sample submissions</h2>
<h3 id="softwarealgorithm-developer">Software/Algorithm Developer</h3>
<p>If applying for the Software/Algorithm Developer position, please see our instructions <a href="/fall-recruiting/dev-samples">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="web-developer-1">Web Developer</h3>
<p>Please show us a website that you’ve developed in the past. The more skills demonstrated in the website (e.g. backend development, user interface design, etc), the better.</p>

<h3 id="3d-artist-1">3D Artist</h3>
<p>Please show us some examples of your work. We’re not picky: Renderings, mockups, anything else you might find relevant.</p>

<h3 id="pr-director">PR Director</h3>
<p>Please do one of the following, or both:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Show us some examples of your past work. These could be blog posts, photos, illustrations, screenshots of social media posts, and so on.</li>
  <li>Suppose we’d like to invite community members to join us as spectators for the completion of Voltron’s <a href="/d2-overview">Grand Tour</a>, our first full lap around campus. Design some materials to promote this event. This can be as simple or as ambitious as you like, but the more creative, the better. We’d like to get a sense of your style.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="education-and-outreach-director-1">Education and Outreach Director</h3>
<p>There’s no sample submission– hooray! Just fill out the form, and we’ll reach out to schedule an interview.</p>

<hr />

<p>We’re really looking forward to hearing from you. Should you have any questions, you can contact the team lead, Will, at <em>will.heitman@utdallas.edu</em>. Best of luck!</p>

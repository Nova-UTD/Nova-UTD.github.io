&lt;p&gt;This is our largest recruiting year ever; we welcomed 14 new
members to the team. 9 of which are part of the development team and 4 of which are part of the
Hardware, Firmware and Electrical (HFE) team. The positive energy and work ethic that we have seen
from this team in just this short period of time gives us high hopes for what this group of talented
individuals can accomplish in the next year. Our current team composition is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our development team consists of returning member Stepan Antonyuk, and new members Neil
Agrawal, Ahmad Bajwa, Anjana Bharadwaj, Vindhya Kaushal, Prateek Mishra, Josh Pahman, Gueren
Sanford, Ayush Sharma, and Haneesh Tummalapalli. On our HFE team, we have returning members
Meyli Colmenero, Sasha Luich, and Jai Peris, with new members Abhinav Gummadi, Yuvraj Kashyap,
Andy Nguyen, and Akhila Varanasi. Fletcher Lauber will join our team as the new PR director where he
will manage digital media and community outreach efforts, and Kyle Zeng will be our photographer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Vayman will be our project lead, and the one and only Justin Ruths will be our glorious
supervisor and advisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/res/headshots/Cropped_Group_Photo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/headshots/Cropped_Group_Photo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Members pose during our 2023 Fall Kickoff&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In true NOVA fashion, we would also like to say goodbye to last year’s members who have moved on
from the project. We appreciate all their valuable contributions to the team, and we would not have
come close to our goals without their commitment to the project.
We have a lot in store for this year, so we would like to briefly explain what we have coming up and
where you can keep up with us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year culminated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHjxz3qC8Q8&quot;&gt;Demo 2&lt;/a&gt;, where Hail Bopp drove us 2 miles east of
campus with no hands on the wheel! We consider it a huge success, and great proof of concept. This
year, we have BIG plans to show what Nova is truly capable of. Our software and hardware have much
to improve and expand upon, so we’ll be busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--- For more detailed information regarding our goals,
please visit ```annual plans will be added to website soon``` for our software and vehicle annual plans respectively. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also for this year, we’ll be much, MUCH more active on social media and beyond. One event coming up
soon is the Richardson Holiday Parade. Keep an eye out Hail Bopp!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep up with our progress and any of our events, follow us on &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/nova.utd&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/nova-utd/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, and
check out the rest of the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you guys soon!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nova</name></author><summary type="html">Welcome aboard, all new NOVA members!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Planning with cost maps</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023/02/13/Planning-with-cost-maps.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Planning with cost maps" /><published>2023-02-13T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-13T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023/02/13/Planning-with-cost-maps</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023/02/13/Planning-with-cost-maps.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/23-02-13-planning-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;You and a flag&quot; style=&quot;zoom:50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you’ve been asked to find the best path to the flag. Using the information given above, the answer obviously looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/23-02-13-planning-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;A straight path directly from you to the flag&quot; style=&quot;zoom:50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if we were given some additional information? If we add elevation data, the “best” path becomes the flattest one, since it takes the least effort:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/23-02-13-planning-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;A curvy path that aligns with the valley between two hills&quot; style=&quot;zoom:50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To us, this solution is intuitive. In fact, most animals can select the optimal path to a goal without even thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, imagine an iguana has just spotted a tasty fly. In finding the best path to this morsel, the iguana uses its beady eyes to scan the world around it, observing the locations of any possible predators and maximizing its distance ($d$) to each. It might prefer a path in the warm sun, so it avoids shady regions ($s$). Finally, to keep the element of surprise, the iguana avoids walking crunchy, noisy surfaces ($n$).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our iguana, this prehistoric, cold-blooded creature, has just performed a multivariate optimization without so much as blinking: $path_{optimal} = \min(-w_1d+w_2s-w_3n)$, where $w$ is a weight for an individual factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/23-02-13-iguana.png&quot; alt=&quot;An iguana thinking about our optimization equation.&quot; style=&quot;zoom:50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s so simple that a lizard can do it instinctively, then surely our car can plan paths in this fashion– right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try dividing the map into cells. We can then assign each cell’s value to be the height at the cell’s center. Below we’ve discretized (categorized) the elevation into four values, but in our actual software, we use over 100 different values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/23-02-13-height-grid.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our elevation map converted into a discrete grid&quot; style=&quot;zoom:50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s generate five paths randomly, stopping each path’s generation when it reaches some distance from the goal. We then select the path where the sum of each intersecting cell’s value is smallest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/23-02-13-height-grid-paths.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our elevation map converted into a discrete grid&quot; style=&quot;zoom:50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example, we’ve generated just five paths. In reality, we might generate hundreds or even thousands. We can further optimize this by create a tree, where multiple paths may start from a common branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real power of this grid-based approach is that each cell’s value can be calculated using multiple factors. Thinking back to the iguana, each cell’s value can be the weighted sum of sunniness, noisiness, and distance from predators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;application-to-autonomous-driving&quot;&gt;Application to autonomous driving&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our upstream software already provides us with plenty of perception data: the location of curbs, pedestrians, cyclists, even fire hydrants. Our mapping and localization systems tell us exactly how far we are from the route, from the lane center, and the speed limits of each map region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See where this is going? Using the factors provided by upstream nodes, we can generate a grid-based map of our vehicle’s current surroundings, then plot our goal on this map. Using the wealth of perception data already available, we assign each cell a cost, which is a big weighted sum from individual factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of sunniness and noise, we now consider distance from the lane center, a cell’s class as either road or not-road, the lane’s speed limit, whether or not a cell is currently occupied, whether we predict it to be occupied in the near future, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take inspiration from &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06806&quot;&gt;“MP3: A Unified Model to Map, Perceive, Predict and Plan”&lt;/a&gt; by Casas, Sadat, and Urtasun. Below are some figures from their paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/23-02-13-mp3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our elevation map converted into a discrete grid&quot; style=&quot;zoom:50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can take the weighted sum of the above values to produce a holistic &lt;strong&gt;cost map&lt;/strong&gt;, a grid map that represents the complete cost of a robot’s choices. We can then apply a number of generative planners, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs1951r/assignments/motionplanning/rrtpaper.pdf&quot;&gt;Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees&lt;/a&gt; (LaValle ‘98), to find an optimal or near-optimal path.&lt;/p&gt;

What are we working on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we’re going to deploy our constantly-improving software, Navigator, into a realistic simulator called CARLA, as part of a global competition. Second, we’re going to load Navigator onto our actual vehicle, and we’ll drive around campus– and perhaps into the world beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-tasks&quot;&gt;Our tasks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have three big ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Task A:&lt;/strong&gt; Get our software working as well as it can in the simulator. This means that we can pick any point on a (city-sized) map, fill the map with a bunch of bad drivers and distracted pedestrians, and watch as our software drives to the goal without a hitch. Fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Task B:&lt;/strong&gt; Prepare our trusty car, Hail-Bopp, with a powerful onboard computer upgrade, remounted sensors, and (maybe) a fancy RTK GNSS, a kind of GPS with enough accuracy to pin down a postage stamp. Success here will mean driving more than a mile around UTD campus without touching the wheel or pedals. We’ll get a human to drive with an Xbox controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Task C:&lt;/strong&gt; Combine the earlier tasks so that Hail-Bopp becomes a real robotaxi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-timeline&quot;&gt;Our timeline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tasks A&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; are due on February 15, just in time for us to present our work at the UTD Homecoming Parade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Task C&lt;/strong&gt; is due on April 28 (&lt;span id=&quot;demo-countdown&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; days as you read this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this crazy? Yes! But my teammates are smart and dedicated, and so we will apply ourselves to get this done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/22-02-02-octovis-mapping.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Octovis mapping&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Real-time voxel mapping with octrees (2x speedup)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-obstacles&quot;&gt;Our obstacles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty, but I’ll focus on three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, state estimation, which is all the calculations that we perform to localize the robot on the map. State estimation has been a persistent thorn in Hail-Bopp’s tire since Nova was founded three years ago. We’ve tried about a dozen algorithms, from the state of the art to the admittedly dubious, and all have failed in one way or another. We’ve recently settled on a method that we believe will work: Monte Carlo localization, which can incorporate a variety of inputs and constraints while maintaining a clear probabilistic model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/22-02-02-dead-reckoning.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Dead reckoning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dead reckoning within our particle filter, using wheel encoders and an IMU. 2x speedup.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, path planning. Both in simulation and in the real world, we’re asking our car to drive through some maddening scenarios: Distracted pedestrians on their phones, buses, amateur skateboarders, dogs, and lots of cars with those “Please be patient, student driver” stickers on the back. Oh boy. And so, several times every second, the path planner needs to weave us through all of this madness without making a single mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/22-02-02-Jai-Meyli-Connor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jai, Meyli, and Connor&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Jai, Connor, and Meyli work on wiring&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, our firmware and hardware tools need to be flawless. We’re fortunate to have great vehicle technicians, but even they have their work cut out for them. Loose wires, miscalibrated sensors, dead batteries, and mysterious firmware bugs all present major hazards as we move from the simulator to real-world deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other challenges, too: Tuning our ML-based motion prediction model, optimizing our ginormous trip routing algorithm, and adding safety checks all come to mind. Nova is not for the faint of heart. But we’ve been through challenges before, and this is no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/22-02-02-SOG.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Our real-time occupancy grid&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Our real-time occupancy grid in action&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-goal&quot;&gt;Our goal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we all commit ourselves to it, which we will, then tasks A, B, and C will lead us to a fully autonomous, open-source, undergrad-built system in less than three months. We will present our work on Demo Day, which is on Friday, April 28 (&lt;span id=&quot;demo-countdown2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; days!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details will follow as we approach that date. In the meantime, I hope to see you at the homecoming parade. Wish us luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anika Nesarikar joins us as our new PR director, where she will manage our community outreach and sponsorship initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jai Peris, Sasha Luich, and Meyli join our veteran member Connor Scally to form our first ever dedicated Hardware, Software, and Electrical group. They each bring valuable experience, and their efforts will keep our vehicle running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chitsein Htun, Hansika Sundaresan, Ashwin Somasundaram, Harsha Kota, Jesse Musa, and Stepan Antonyuk form our core development team, which is in charge of designing algorithms and writing new code for &lt;a href=&quot;https://nova-utd.github.io/navigator/&quot;&gt;Navigator&lt;/a&gt;. They are managed by Daniel Vayman, our first-ever development lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d also like to say goodbye to some departing members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dylan Hiu, last year’s PR Director, was the first to ever hold the position. He wrote member highlights for our website that brought credit to the contributions of our members. He started our Instgram account and produced some excellent videos for the team, even following the car on his skateboard to get some shots in motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egan Johnson, Jim Moore, Nikhil Narvekar, Ragib Arnab, and Joshua Williams each left a huge impact on our project as core developers. They spent many late nights/early mornings in our lab doing everything necessary to get our goals met. While each of them was capable of thinking through complex math and high-level planning, they were inevitably asked to do unglamorous work, too: fixing broken dependencies, tracing loose wires on the car, and resolving segmentation faults (ugh). There are rumors that a couple of them will make their return to Nova in the future… In any case, they were all-stars.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s been nearly two months since we’ve updated you on our progress. Things have been crazy here at Nova. We’ve recently migrated our entire simulation environment to &lt;a href=&quot;carlasim.org&quot;&gt;CARLA&lt;/a&gt;. We took part in UTD’s Homecoming Parade with no one in our driver’s seat (see Dylan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/aLeqj5ZyQQI&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;). Our brake pedal’s linear actuator suddenly broke, so we’ve had to revamp our pdeal actuation. On and on, everyone on the team is involved in something new, interesting, and challenging. Really challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add to all this, we’ve recently crossed the two month mark: Less than two months until Demo 2 has to be wrapped up, recorded, and in the books. Making Demo 2 work is like making a ball out of rubber bands. Anyone who’s tried this will understand that the bands will bend and sag and snap, and you’re dealing with the bending and sagging and snapping of all the bands at once, and they’re twisting and slipping until, all of a sudden, you have a neat, colorful ball in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just to say that the ball is being made. All of our components, from semantic segmentation to PWM interfaces to map routing, are steadily, twistingly coming together. And in two months the ball will be formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to spy on us, you can track our code’s evoluton in real-time &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Nova-UTD/navigator/commits/dev&quot;&gt;on our GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. If you see us testing on campus soon, be sure to wave hello. And be ready to jump out of the way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Comets! From all of us on the Nova team, we hope that you had a restful, restorative, and comfortable break. As we head back to our campus in these uncertain times, we are all hoping that you stay safe, take care of one another, and have a productive start to the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all of us are coming back to our campus and preparing for our classes, Nova is continuing as usual. We have been working our hardest in order to successfully demonstrate a functional autonomous vehicle in just a few short months. Our team has worked continuously throughout the winter break to get closer to bringing this project to life, and we are so excited to share our work with you soon! In the meantime, we would like to shine a spotlight this week on one of the members of our Behavior Planning and Controls team, Egan Johnson!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egan is one of the members of our Behavior Planning &amp;amp; Controls team. Egan is a sophomore studying computer science and hails from the Madison, Wisconsin area. He greatly enjoys running, and was nationally competitive on his high school cross country team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Nova, Egan is something of a veteran, being one of the original members of the Nova team.  Last year, Egan helped work on connecting the data taken from Nova’s mounted LIDAR sensors and converted it into workable data for the algorithms held within Nova’s onboard computer, the Jetson. He was responsible for designing the softwares that converted this information into the “point clouds” that frequent nearly all of Nova’s simulations and programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, as part of the Behavior Planning &amp;amp; Controls team, Egan is working extensively on Hail Bopp’s route planner. While the route planner already existed on the vehicle, the older version of the system was very rudimentary, and could only navigate a very simple route in an empty parking lot. The existing system did not include the capability to navigate anything other than bidirectional roads and could not work with lane changes (both of which are, of course, very important to get right when we are trying to get this vehicle onto real roads!). This is now Egan’s project: designing a machine that can plot a path to get from one point to another with the “least cost,” or with the least amount of distance or travel time. This time, the process needs to account for every possible route with all lanes on the road considered!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/res/22-01-11_Egan_Johnson-DataMap.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/22-01-11_Egan_Johnson-DataMap.png&quot; alt=&quot;Datamap with Raw View&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/res/22-01-11_Egan_Johnson-OverviewMap.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/22-01-11_Egan_Johnson-OverviewMap.png&quot; alt=&quot;Datamap with Map View&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a complex process, involving the softwares in the machine retrieving information from the onboard LIDAR and depth map sensors, along with the calculations from the Perception team’s algorithms, in order to conceptualize all safe, followable paths for the vehicle. These potential paths are updated constantly many times per second in order to have up-to-date routes as new obstacles or variables present themselves around the vehicle. Out of all of these routes, one specific path is chosen by the software for the vehicle to follow, with the safest and most comfortable path being chosen (the code and decisions made on how which of these paths best fit these characteristics will be covered in a Deep-Dive to come!) After this curve is generated and chosen, the path information is passed on to the Controls team, where that data is converted into commands for the wheel, throttle, and brake motors to actuate in specific patterns in order to follow the given path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egan has spent a great deal of time working on Nova. He has a great deal of experience working on the project, and from this, has a piece of advice for students: get involved! From his point of view, Egan says that there are so many small details that go into designing these systems that just are not seen from the outside. There is so much to learn from getting more deeply invested in projects. For Egan, this experience has been great…and for you, the reader, Egan recommends that you do the same! There is so much to gain from being involved, and it can open so many doors to fantastic projects and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continue to work on our project, expect to hear much more from us soon. We cannot wait to show you what we have done, and we wish you all good luck on the start to the new school year!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dylan Hiu</name></author><category term="Deep" /><category term="Dives" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Firmware Specialist - Avery Bainbridge</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/deep/dives/2021/11/12/Firmware-Specialist-Deep-Dive.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Firmware Specialist - Avery Bainbridge" /><published>2021-11-12T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-11-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/deep/dives/2021/11/12/Firmware-Specialist-Deep-Dive</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/deep/dives/2021/11/12/Firmware-Specialist-Deep-Dive.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/res/headshots/avery_bainbridge.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/headshots/avery_bainbridge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Headshot of Avery&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Avery Bainbridge, Nova’s Firmware Specialist.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, we introduced you to Nova’s Technical Artist, Phu Le. You got to hear a little more about the work that is going into Demo 2…but our 3D models are only the start of what’s cooking. There is still so much else we have going on at Nova: this week, you will be learning more about another critical member of our team, Avery Bainbridge, who serves as Nova’s Firmware Specialist!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avery is in charge of taking the rest of the team’s code and putting it all together on the “Jetson.” The Jetson is the name of Hail Bopp’s onboard computer. It is a small version of any other computer, with CPU processors, graphics processors, and a huge assortment of other bits and bobs. The powerful GPU’s in the Jetson are not just for games; in fact, they are in charge of a very a large portion of the thinking that our vehicle does! Avery’s job is to ensure that all of the code created by our team works together seamlessly with the Jetson, along with ensuring the data sent to the Jetson from our onboard sensors interfaces correctly with our systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avery hails from Boise, Idaho, and brings a wealth of experience to this position. In high school, Avery was a member of the FIRST Robotics Competitions (FRC) for four years, and spent a huge amount of time working on microcontroller projects on his own time. He learned the tricks of the trade through countless hours of work in robotics and vision processing: in his own words, “Quite a bit of what you expect when you program is that you have an operating system underneath you. They helped you out. You have to learn sort of how to do without it when you’re doing microcontroller programming.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few weeks, Avery has been working on integrating the GPS receiver from Hail Bopp into workable code for the rest of the team. The written code from our team talks to our GPS modules and needs to receive back workable position and velocity data to interface with the rest of the systems in the vehicle.  Interfacing this code is not trivial: there are an enormous amount of issues to solve before any of this data can be usable for us. Differences in communication protocols, changing the GPS’ positioning function from an ellipsoid to a reference geoid, properly passing the latitude, longitude, and altitude data to the localization stack to be processed…All of this information is needed to give Hail Bopp a “ground truth” to determine its exact position in space. Avery is the man responsible for making it all happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/res/21-11-12_Avery_Bainbridge_working.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/21-11-12_Avery_Bainbridge_working.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of Avery working in the Lab&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Avery at work in the Nova lab.&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avery’s work has become a bedrock for the project, and has been essential to getting us up and running this semester. In recognition of his excellent work, Avery is the first recipient of Nova’s weekly award…our rubber chicken! Avery will hold onto this prize for a grand total of one week before it is passed on to next week’s Nova Member of the Week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/res/21-11-12-Avery_Bainbridge_chicken.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/21-11-12-Avery_Bainbridge_chicken.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image of Avery with our rubber chicken&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;small&gt;Avery being recognized with Nova’s extra-special rubber chicken.&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avery wants students to remember that in technology, underneath all of the high-level functionality and capability they possess that seem like magic, there is an enormous amount of work that goes into the essential functions of the product. Underneath the higher level abstractions of the product, “It’s not magic, and that there are real people such as myself.” He wants to remind students that underneath all of the code and functions, to quote Isaac Newton, “Don’t forget that you’re working on the shoulders of giants.” Nova constantly relies on Avery to keep everything on the right track, and we cannot do our work without him!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dylan Hiu</name></author><category term="Deep" /><category term="Dives" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Data Visualization &amp;amp; Interface - Raghav Pillai</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/deep/dives/2021/11/12/Data-Visualization-&-Interface.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Data Visualization &amp;amp; Interface - Raghav Pillai" /><published>2021-11-12T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-11-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/deep/dives/2021/11/12/Data-Visualization-&amp;-Interface</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/deep/dives/2021/11/12/Data-Visualization-&amp;-Interface.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/res/headshots/raghav_pillai.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/headshots/raghav_pillai.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Headshot of Raghav&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our previous post, we debuted our weekly tradition of awarding our prized Rubber Chicken to a member of the Nova team who we feel deserves special recognition for their contributions to our goals. This week, we recognize Raghav Pillai, our head of Data Visualization &amp;amp; Interface design!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/res/21-11-12_Raghav_Chicken.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/21-11-12_Raghav_Chicken.png&quot; alt=&quot;Raghav with Chicken&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raghav’s recognition this week emphasizes his dedication to Nova and the hard work he’s put into the project. Aside from Nova, Raghav is an active student around campus, being involved with multiple other projects. A junior in computer science, Raghav is involved extracurriculars both at an undergraduate level and with other graduate students. In fact, Raghav recently place second in Hack UTD in the category of Investment Strategies for Goldman Sachs! He has spent a great deal of time working in freelance and full-stack code development, and his wealth of experience elevates Nova to an entirely different level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raghav’s role in Nova as the head of Data Visualization combines the work of multiple different members of the team. His aim is to take the raw data from Hail Bopp’s sensors along with the data from our GPS and positional equipment mounted on the vehicle and convert them into a visual representation of what the vehicle “sees” as it travels through space. This work is a complicated process that involves collaboration with almost every group within Nova. For example, Data from the Perception Team is needed in order to process and identify the surroundings of the vehicle. 3D renders from our Technical Artist are needed to be integrated with this data in order to have models for the identified objects. Finally, Raghav’s work helps collect all of this information together to accurately represent the space around the vehicle. This data will eventually be displayed on a monitor mounted on the interior of the vehicle, allowing the operator and passengers to have an idea of what the car is detecting around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/res/21-11-12_Overhead_Visualization.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/21-11-12_Overhead_Visualization.png&quot; alt=&quot;Overhead Visualization&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of operation is critical for multiple reasons. The first is that from an engineering perspective, we need to be able to know precisely what the car detects around it. Without this data, creating a safe path for the vehicle to follow is impossible. It also prevents us from being able to create functional emergency stop algorithms. After all, if the vehicle is not able to detect obstacles in its path, then to the car, there is no reason to stop. This, of course, is not ideal for us: we would prefer if Hail Bopp did not ram itself through a bush in its path that it failed to detect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other reason that Raghav’s work is so important is that it greatly increases the feeling of safety and security for passengers. Imagine if, as a passenger in a self-driving vehicle, the car began to drive, brake, and steer without any indication of what the car is aware of. This can be extremely unsettling for passengers. However, the digital visualization of what is around the vehicle can give customers a sense of security. Knowing that the car can also see the obstacles and surroundings in the same way that the passengers do can be reassuring for those unfamiliar with autonomous vehicles. In fact, since the car can receive data from all around the vehicle and display an intuitive top-down view of its surroundings, the visualization can give passengers a sense that the vehicle is entirely in control in its environment. You can a closer look at the beginning of this visualization below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/res/21-11-12_Overhead_Visualization_2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/21-11-12_Overhead_Visualization_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Overhead Visualization 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raghav’s work accomplishes these aims, but he also recognizes the contributions of that of the rest of the team to his work. To Raghav, “What Nova is more than anything is that it’s kind of a symbol to show what you can do with a team with people who are motivated. It’s a symbol of what we can do together if we work together as a team.” He also offers students who have big dreams some encouragement: “This project is a testament to all the people out there who don’t know where to get started. You just need to get started to make something.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dylan Hiu</name></author><category term="Deep" /><category term="Dives" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Technical Artist Deep Dive - Phu Le</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/deep/dives/2021/11/04/Technical-Artist-Deep-Dive.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Technical Artist Deep Dive - Phu Le" /><published>2021-11-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-11-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/deep/dives/2021/11/04/Technical-Artist-Deep-Dive</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/deep/dives/2021/11/04/Technical-Artist-Deep-Dive.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/res/headshots/phu_le.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/headshots/phu_le.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Headshot of Phu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Phu Le, Nova’s Technical Artist.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UT Dallas’ autonomous vehicle project is underway! This Fall, 15 undergraduate students have come together to continue the process of creating a fully functional self-driving vehicle, entirely from scratch. This is no small feat, and has the Nova team working on an enormous array of issues around the clock in order to make this dream a reality. Nova’s aim this year is Demo 2: an ambitious project with an aim to have the project’s vehicle, Hail Bopp (a retrofitted Polaris Gem) safely complete an entirely autonomous loop around the streets surrounding the perimeter of UT Dallas alongside the traffic, skateboarders, and Tobors UTD students are familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Nova’s testbed vehicle, Hail Bopp, can make its way to the streets of UTD, each member of the team will have to sort their way through an array of problems. Nearly all of these problems will be solved through simulations in virtual environments. Every scenario needs to be tested thousands of times before Hail Bopp can make its way out of the garage on its own. However, in order to test the vehicle, we need a digital environment to test it in…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, we will be taking a deep-dive on Phu Le, Nova’s Technical Artist. A sophomore in Computer Science, Phu has spent years learning graphic design and 3D modeling…entirely on his own. Through Youtube, online tutorials, and an enormous amount of practice, Phu has honed his skills to the point that he can fly through Blender and Photoshop with no issue. These skills were good enough that Phu has already spent time interning for a professional photography firm as a graphic designer. A member of the Student Game Developer Association on campus, Phu has a great deal of experience and talent in regards to environment and object design, animation, and 3D modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/res/2021-11-04-Phu_Le_Portfolio1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/2021-11-04-Phu_Le_Portfolio1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image from Phu's online portfolio&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/res/2021-11-04-Phu_Le-Portfolio2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/res/2021-11-04-Phu_Le-Portfolio2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Second from Phu's online portfolio&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Images from Phu’s previous work in 3D modeling and game design.&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Nova, Phu has been tasked with creating a 3D, detailed render of Hail Bopp from top-to-bottom. Polaris, the manufacturer of the Gem vehicle used as the basis of the project, does not have any scan or model of the vehicle available, leaving it up to Phu to create them for us from scratch! This model will be used in all future simulations for the entirety of the project, and will allow the Nova team to approximate their simulations against reality. In addition, Phu will also be in charge of environment design for these virtual environments as well, with some of them being the streets, buildings, and trees around our campus. In fact, Phu plans on modeling the entirety of UT Dallas in the future! He has also in charge of designing Nova’s logos and marketing materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These extremely detailed environments make it possible for the developers to stress-test, challenge, and generally put Hail Bopp through hell without putting anyone (or the vehicle!) in harms way. This process is very similar to how Tesla uses their own in-house environment to test their vehicles before production. Since Phu can change these environments at will, the team can put the vehicle through any situation they can possibly think of. His work is incredibly important to ensuring that by Demo 2, Hail Bopp will be able to face all sorts of situations and can navigate any environment it may encounter while navigating UTD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phu’s work makes it possible for the rest of the team to simulate their designs in environments very similar to what we will face in Demo 2. In future updates, keep an eye out for his renders in Nova’s testing simulations!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dylan Hiu</name></author><category term="Deep" /><category term="Dives" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>

# Getting to Know Voltron
Voltron is an autonomous low speed vehicle developed by undergraduate students at UT Dallas.

## Base hardware
Our base vehicle is a **Polaris GEM e6**. Don't be fooled: the GEM is no plain golf cart. It includes
- all-electric drivetrain,
- regenerative braking, 
- an automotive-grade, Li-Ion battery bank,
- a full CAN bus,
- a 50 mile range,
- a top speed of ~40 km/h (25 mph)

## Added hardware
We've added hardware to the stock GEM, including:
- Velodyne Puck Lidar sensors (1 front, 1 rear)
- ZED 2i stereo camera ()

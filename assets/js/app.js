I'm a senior in Computer Engineering hailing from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I like to bike, cook, and read. My teammates usually see me in Leader Mode, but I'm actually introverted.<br/><br/>I have some really talented teammates working on this project, and I just want to support them in any way I can. And of course, I want this car to drive itself as my <strike>personal chauffeur</strike> ahem, a valuable research platform for UTD!<br/><br/>I'm always open to questions or comments about our work.

        Bio: " Living in the suburbs of Richardson requires a lot of driving, and frankly I'm tired of it. Honestly was just looking for a quick and easy driving service but I somehow ended up on a research team chock-full of the most diverse, talented, and determined people I've had the opportunity of working with. All jokes aside, I'm from St. Louis, MO, and I'm a freshman here at UT Dallas studying computer science. I've been coding since my freshman year of high school and I've gained most of my programming/leadership experience through FIRST Robotics. My hobbies include sleeping, exercising, volleyball, tournament poker, and watching movies/TV. I'm also on the UTD Men's Ultimate Frisbee team! In addition to being a great resource for my fellow core developers, I will strive to be an excellent leader. I'm a full believer in Nova and I'll be putting forth my best effort into seeing the project come to fruition. I can't wait to see what we accomplish. Any questions about our project or the work that we do? Feel free to shoot me an email. daniel.vayman@utdallas.edu"

        Bio: "Hey! My name is Raghav Pillai, and I'm a Junior here at UTD studying Computer Science. I'm hoping to go into an emerging technology like deep learning or edge computing in the future. I handle the development of all of the human-car interfacing, being able to see and interpret the massive amount of data and telemetry we get from our stack and maintain our website (as you're reading!). <br/><br/>I'm originally from Arkansas, but grew up in the Dallas Metroplex. I've been interested in machines and computers for as long as I can remember, and have worked on both hardware and software side of things. I grew up modding and creating small games, which got me into programming and designing projects. If I'm not working on projects for work or doing schoolwork, I'm probably watching a show or playing some games. <br/><br/>We'll be sure to put on a good show here at Nova, and I'm excited for the possibilities with our team."

I first began coding when I was in 6th grade and began enjoying it through building small indie games with friends. In the past few years, I have become increasingly interested in studying complex systems involving individual agents, which has drawn me to topics like game theory and AI. Working on Nova’s autonomous vehicle system lets me continue to pursue these interests by presenting a chance to both design a complex system under the hood and to create an AI that can learn and adapt to the even more complex system of people, creatures, and robots navigating the streets of our busy world. I look forward to learning more about everything that the world of autonomous vehicles encompasses, developing our open source autonomous vehicle platform, and working with the other members of our amazing team!"

        Bio: "Living in the suburbs of Richardson requires a lot of driving, and frankly I'm tired of it. Honestly was just looking for a quick and easy driving service but I somehow ended up on a research team chock-full of the most diverse, talented, and determined people I've had the opportunity of working with. All jokes aside, I'm from St. Louis, MO, and I'm a second-year here at UT Dallas studying computer science. I've been coding since my freshman year of high school and I discovered my passion for autonomous systems through FIRST Robotics. My hobbies include ultimate frisbee, rock climbing, running, cooking, reading, and watching movies/TV. In addition to being a great resource for my fellow developers and vehicle engineers, I strive to be an excellent leader. I'm a full believer in Nova and I'll be putting forth my best effort into seeing the project come to fruition. I can't wait to see what we accomplish. Any questions about our project or the work that we do? Feel free to shoot me an email. daniel.vayman@utdallas.edu"

        Bio: "I’m from Dallas, Texas and I’m currently studying electrical engineering. I’m most interested in embedded systems, nanotechnology, and physics, and I hope to one day work with renewable energy or quantum technology. With Nova, I serve as a firmware and electrical engineer. My team is responsible for mapping the circuitry of the car, testing the sensors, and much more! Besides work, I like to cook, read, and play videogames. I am super excited to see this car drive itself!"

        Bio: "I first encountered Google at the age of 8, and it felt like pure magic. The idea that typing something into a small box on a screen could provide all the information I needed was mind-blowing. It left me absolutely fascinated. As I grew older, technology continued to amaze me. Concepts like machine learning and self-driving cars, once the stuff of science fiction, are now fields I'm actively pursuing. I'm on a path to contribute to building these futuristic technologies. My current focus is on enhancing Nova, and my passion for technology plays a significant role in that. Nova not only helps me evolve as a developer but also as a researcher, thanks to the incredible resources it offers. I aspire to delve deeper into AI and machine learning concepts through my work. Outside of that, I enjoy watching and playing soccer, as well as trying out new video games."

I’m from a small town in Ohio where living in the rust belt meant constantly working on cars to keep them operational.  At 16 I finally got a car of my own, a 1979 Corvette that is truly my pride and joy, allowing me to gain even more automotive experience and motivating me to pursue mechanical engineering.  Now, I would like to continue my engineering endeavor and branch out to electric cars with Nova!"

I'm proud to welcome nine new members to Voltron, bringing our full team to fifteen talented undergrads. One year ago, Voltron was just one undergrad and a faculty advisor. Six additional undergrad students carried us through [Demo 1](/d1-overview). As we begin our push toward [Demo 2](/d2-overview), I know that our new members will be a big help.

Our new members consist of algorithm development specialists, a technical artist, a PR director, a simulation engineer, a web application developer, and an education and outreach director. Each new member brings their own unique skillset, and I'm excited to see where we'll go together. Autonomous driving is a crazy path to travel on, and it's always better travel with a group.

While I welcome our new members, I'd also like to take a moment to give a big thank you and farewell to Grace Zhu. Grace was instrumental in developing our map data for Demo 1. Many of the mapping techniques that we rely on today were discovered by Grace, and she has made a lasting impression on our project. Grace has recently moved back to UT Austin, where she studies as a CS undergrad.

Take a look at our updated membership section, where you can click on each of our members to read their story. One more welcome to Nikhil, Jim, Ragib, Avery, Connor, Dylan, Quinn, Phu, and Raghav!
